# Sharing-Is-Caring

Here is my Summative Presentation. For my Sharing is Caring project. I am going to help share and spread awareness promoting this particular cancer research foundation: Cancer Research UK Kids & Teens which I found online. Cancer is something which is close to my heart because I have lost my bestfriend and a few close friends over diagnosed with this illness. I have been through there with them suffering, recovering and relapse and passes away. I find Cancer is a disease that kills our mankind faster than any other diseases. It hurts me to see when children as young as two years old have cancer and have to go through the torture recovering process. Is wonderful to see a foundation such as Cancer Research UK.
